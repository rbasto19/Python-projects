# Python-projects
Two of my most recent personal python projects: 
- Model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) for molecule generation diffusion models (in progress, and I labeled the parts that I contributed by adding the flag "#MY CONTRIBUTION")
- Polarization of boron vacancy defect through spin-locking pulse sequence (everything is my code)
